# Parking Space Sharing Platform Requirements Document

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the functional and system requirements for the Parking Space Sharing Platform. The platform aims to address traffic congestion issues due to parking issue near University Avenue by providing a system for real-time parking availability, community parking space sharing, and improved user experience.

## 2. Scope
The Parking Space Sharing Platform is designed to serve drivers, residents, and businesses in the University Avenue area. It will provide:
- Real-time parking availability information via mobile apps.
- A platform for residents and businesses to list unused parking spaces.
- A seamless reservation and payment system for parking spots.  

**Validation of Requirements** : These are provided by Research support

## 3. Functional Requirements

**FR1: The system shall provide real-time updates on parking spot availability.**  
- **Research Support:**
  - The report identifies "cruising for parking" as a major contributor to traffic congestion (30% of urban congestion) and highlights the lack of real-time parking data in existing solutions like Passport Parking.
  - Proposed sensors align with the "Real-Time Parking Availability" section, which emphasizes reducing search time through live updates.

**FR2: The system shall allow users to view and navigate to available parking spots through a user friendly application.**  
- **Research Support:**
  - Driver behavior analysis shows drivers prefer free/on-street parking, leading to congestion. A guided app would direct users to underutilized off-street or shared spaces.
  - The "Unique Solution" section explicitly proposes app integration to address this gap.

**FR3: The system shall enable residents and businesses to list unused parking spaces for sharing.**  
- **Research Support:**
  - The "Community Participation" idea is justified by the limited parking infrastructure in Uptown Waterloo (e.g., Regina Lot often full).
  - The Uptown Parking Strategy and community feedback stress the need to optimize existing resources.

**FR4: The system shall allow drivers to book parking spaces in real-time.**  
- **Research Support:**
  - High demand during events/peak hours (CityNews Kitchener) necessitates immediate booking capabilities to prevent congestion.
  - LocoMobi Worldâ€™s system for parking garages validates the feasibility of real-time management.

**FR5: The system shall include a review and rating system for shared parking spaces.**  
- **Research Support:**
  - Community complaints (Reddit, City of Waterloo bylaws) highlight trust issues and parking frustrations. A rating system ensures accountability and quality, indirectly supporting user adoption.
