# Parking Space Sharing App Development Plan

## Epic 1: Core Infrastructure & Real-Time System Foundation
**Goal:** Establish backend, hardware, and connectivity for real-time updates.

### Priority 1: Hardware & Network Setup
**User Stories:**
- **SR1 - Admin:** As a system administrator, I want IoT sensors to monitor parking spot occupancy so that drivers receive accurate updates.
- **SR4 - Admin:** As a system administrator, I want stable internet connectivity to ensure real-time updates for drivers and parking space owners.

### Priority 2: Backend & API Development
**User Stories:**
- **SR2 - System:** As a system, I want cloud-based infrastructure to handle real-time data processing and storage so that the platform remains scalable and efficient.
- **SR5 - System:** As a system, I want APIs to facilitate communication between sensors, mobile apps, and backend servers so that all components work seamlessly.
