**Introduction**

Traffic congestion is a significant issue in the Kitchener-Waterloo area, particularly during peak hours. Several factors contribute to this problem:

1. **Population Growth**: The region has experienced rapid population growth, leading to increased vehicle usage.
2. **Urban Development**: Expansion of residential and commercial areas has resulted in more vehicles on the road.
3. **Limited Public Transit Options**: While there are public transit services, they may not be sufficient to meet the needs of the growing population.
4. **Road Infrastructure**: Some roads and intersections may not be designed to handle the current traffic volumes.
5. **Parking Congestion**: This problem often leads to traffic delays and frustration for drivers trying to find parking spaces.
