## Introduction : 

Traffic congestion is a significant issue in the Kitchener-Waterloo area, particularly during peak hours. Several factors contribute to this problem:

1. **Population Growth**: The region has experienced rapid population growth, leading to increased vehicle usage.
2. **Urban Development**: Expansion of residential and commercial areas has resulted in more vehicles on the road.
3. **Limited Public Transit Options**: While there are public transit services, they may not be sufficient to meet the needs of the growing population.
4. **Road Infrastructure**: Some roads and intersections may not be designed to handle the current traffic volumes.
5. **Parking Congestion**: This problem often leads to traffic delays and frustration for drivers trying to find parking spaces.

## Problem Focus: Parking Congestion and Its Impact on Traffic Management

While multiple factors influence traffic congestion, parking congestion near University Avenue in Uptown Waterloo stands out as a significant and recurring challenge. High demand, limited availability, and inefficient parking search behaviors contribute to unnecessary vehicle circulation, adding to traffic density during peak hours.

## Problem Analysis in a Small Part of Kitchener-Waterloo Region: Parking Congestion near University Avenue, Uptown Waterloo

Parking congestion in Uptown Waterloo is a significant issue due to the high volume of visitors and limited parking availability. Drivers spend considerable time searching for available parking spots, which contributes to traffic congestion and delays.

## Comming Up with the [Solution Work click me](./Solution_Deliverable_1.md):  Parking Space Sharing App

The Parking Space Sharing Platform aims to alleviate parking congestion near University Avenue by using sensors to detect real-time parking availability and integrating this data into a mobile app that guides drivers to open spots. Additionally, it encourages community participation by allowing residents and businesses to list their unused parking spaces on the app, enabling drivers to book these spaces in real-time. This solution leverages technology and community involvement to make parking more efficient and accessible in a high-demand area.

## Statistics 
Based on available research and studies, here are some key statistics about traffic congestion caused by drivers searching for parking:
1.	**Proportion of Traffic**: Studies estimate that up to 30% of urban traffic congestion is caused by vehicles cruising for parking, particularly in densely populated areas.
2.	**Time Spent Searching**: On average, drivers spend 8 to 15 minutes searching for parking in congested urban areas. This contributes significantly to delays and inefficiencies in traffic flow.
3.	**Environmental Impact**: The additional fuel consumption from vehicles cruising for parking leads to increased emissions. For example, it is estimated that cruising for parking in a single city can produce thousands of tons of CO2 annually.
4.	**Economic Costs**: The time and fuel wasted while searching for parking have economic implications, including increased costs for commuters and businesses.
These statistics highlight the critical role parking congestion plays in urban traffic issues and reinforce the importance of addressing this problem to improve traffic flow and reduce environmental and economic impacts.

## Deliverable 3 

Writing the actionable tasks associated with all the requirements.

## Purpose

This document outlines the user stories and associated sub-issues for the functional and system requirements of a smart parking management system. It serves as a comprehensive reference for stakeholders, developers, and project managers to understand the goals of the system from the usersâ€™ perspectives and to break down each requirement into actionable development tasks. The content ensures alignment between technical implementation and user needs, covering aspects such as real-time parking availability, mobile app functionality, parking space sharing, secure transactions, and system infrastructure.
